# Renderer
	- We'll render tiles. LWJGL can render squares, known as quads
	- How do we render quads?
	- Can we rotate them to create isometric tiles?
	
	- if we have isometric textures, do we need isometric quads?

	- can we render transparent quads?
	- can we render multiple layers, such that we have a world with items / entities on top
	
# Textures
	- How will we load them?
	- How do we texture a quad?


# Tiles
	- How will we keep track of what tiles we have? Enumerate them?
	- How will we store the behaviours of each tile? i.e can we walk there, etc
	
	- can we animate tiles? i.e water, foliage
